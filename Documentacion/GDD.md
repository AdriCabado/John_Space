A 2d game where im combining the classic game Asteroids with the modern genre Vampire Survivors, it is called John Space, where John is an alien that pilots his ship (the main character).

- John have 100 hp and each asteroid hit will do 20 damage to John.

- Each  game lasts 5 minutes and the main character levels up until the weapons are all maxed (10 levels).

   - Cannon: A cannon that shoots in front of the ship on cooldown.
   - Laser: A laser on the front of the ship that goes on and off on cooldown.
   - Rocket launcher: A rocket launcher that goes on random directions.
   - Electric field: An electic field that rotates around John and harms close asteroids.
   - Shield: A shield that destroy asteroids that touchs John but only has 1 hit until need a recharge.
